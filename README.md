🍴 Cafeteria System – Database Design with MySQL 🗃️

Proud to share a project where I designed a robust MySQL database for a university cafeteria system. The database efficiently handles:

✅ Order management
✅ Menu & pricing
✅ Inventory tracking
✅ Daily sales records

This system aims to optimize cafeteria operations with clean ERD structure, proper normalization, and reliable SQL queries.

🧑‍💻 Designed using MySQL only — with scalability and performance in mind.
